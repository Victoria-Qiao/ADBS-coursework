## Description
This project aimed to implement a program that takes in a database (a set of files with data) and an input file containing one SQL query. The program will process and evaluate the SQL query on the database and write the query result in the specified output file.

The program can process SELECT-FROM-WHERE queries, which may optionally also have a DISTINCT, an ORDER BY, or both.
